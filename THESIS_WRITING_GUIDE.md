# Thesis Writing Guide

This file is the standing editorial guide for this thesis. Update it whenever a
new recurring preference, technical convention, or evidence rule is agreed.
The current thesis contains one combined Results and Discussion chapter.

## Scientific narrative

Write the thesis as one completed engineering investigation:

problem → necessary theory → controller design → experimental method →
measurements → interpretation → limitations → conclusions.

Do not narrate the history of the code, repository, experiments, drafts, or
interpretation. The controller source is evidence used to verify the technical
description; it is not the subject of the thesis.

Use declarative scientific prose. Do not create headings or passages framed as
“Research Question”, “Experimental Question”, “RQ1”, “central question”, or
similar. State the investigated dependencies directly. For example:

> The experimental study evaluates the influence of tangential rotational
> stiffness and virtual centre-of-compliance placement on contact-induced tool
> alignment.

Use “aim”, “objective”, and “investigation” sparingly. Avoid proposal wording
for completed work (`will investigate`, `is planned`, `will be evaluated`).
Future work is the only place for proposed experiments.

## Roles of the chapters

- Introduction: define the contact-alignment problem, relevant literature gap,
  scope, and substantial contributions.
- Theoretical Background: explain only the mathematics required to understand
  the controller and experiments.
- Controller Design and Implementation: explain how the verified controller
  realizes the theory, without line-by-line code narration.
- Experimental Methodology: document what was used, varied, held constant,
  recorded, and calculated in the completed experiments.
- Results and Discussion: report observations, quantitative analysis,
  interpretation, and evidence limitations.
- Conclusion: state what was learned without repeating the full controller
  architecture.

Explain a concept authoritatively once. In particular, avoid repeating
Cartesian impedance, point-shift derivations, gain transformations, damping,
null-space projection, or energy/passivity arguments across chapters.

## Style

Use clear technical English rather than rhetorical or promotional language.
Avoid expressions such as:

- “the answer is visible before any fitting”;
- “a sweep is worth nothing until…”;
- “costs alignment and buys nothing”;
- “this is the substantive question”;
- “surprisingly”, “remarkably”, “clearly”, or “as can easily be seen”;
- repeated “This demonstrates that…” constructions.

Prefer the sequence:

measured value → comparison → interpretation → limitation.

Do not over-academize simple statements. Prefer “The measured alignment
increased as rotational stiffness decreased” over inflated wording.

Use British spelling consistently, including `centre`, `behaviour`, and
`optimisation`, except in literal software identifiers.

## Repository and software language

Do not mention Git repositories, branches, tags, commits, checkouts,
uncommitted changes, earlier implementations, or draft-merging history in the
thesis. Reproducibility should be expressed using scientifically relevant
information such as:

- robot and tool;
- operating system, real-time kernel, compiler, Eigen, and libfranka versions;
- control and logging rates;
- tool geometry and robot transforms;
- active controller parameters;
- experimental procedure and repetitions.

Different configurations may be distinguished only when the difference
materially affects the scientific interpretation.

## Evidence and claims

Never invent measurements, repetitions, fitted values, confidence intervals,
p-values, contact locations, timing bounds, or safety conclusions.

Distinguish:

1. measured observation;
2. model-based interpretation;
3. hypothesis requiring another experiment.

Use `model-estimated external wrench` for
`O_F_ext_hat_K`. Do not call it a directly measured wrench. A location inferred
from that signal is an `equivalent contact location`, not necessarily a
physical point contact.

Use `repeatability-based interpretation threshold` for the approximately
two-standard-deviation threshold from five repetitions. Do not present it as a
universal noise floor or formal equivalence test.

The fitted compliance-centre model is an **additive** or **separable quadratic
response model** unless a \(t_1t_2\) interaction term is estimated. The
cross-shaped sampling does not identify that interaction. The location near
\(t_1=62\,\mathrm{mm}\), \(t_2=30\,\mathrm{mm}\) is a
**model-predicted local optimum**, not an experimentally confirmed optimum.
A single unused point is a **held-out consistency check**, not broad external
validation.

Avoid absolute normal-coordinate claims. Use:

> Within the investigated configuration and parameter range, the normal
> compliance-centre coordinate provided little additional explanatory power
> after accounting for the two in-plane coordinates.

If damping was not varied, report only that no sustained oscillation was
observed with the selected damping. Do not claim a measured damping effect.

Keep the null-space theory and implementation, but do not claim experimentally
improved singularity conditioning until matched controlled trials exist.

## Technical conventions that must remain explicit

- Wrench ordering is force followed by moment.
- Position error is desired minus current.
- State the orientation-error convention and frame in which its components are
  expressed.
- The Jacobian-transpose mapping and null-space projector convention must match
  the implementation.
- Six singular values belong to the \(6\times7\) Jacobian;
  \(\sigma_{\min}=\sigma_6\), while \(v_7\) is the structural null direction at
  full row rank.
- A retained singular value is inverted as \(1/\sigma_i\).
- Distinguish the virtual-centre lever
  \(r_c=p_{\mathrm{TCP}}-p_c\) from the physical-contact lever
  \(r_C=p_C-p_{\mathrm{TCP}}\).
- Keep frame labels, signs, units, control frequency, and actual parameter
  values.
- Distinguish the controller’s lack of an additional application-level
  saturation stage from command handling performed by libfranka.

The complete centre-of-compliance derivation belongs once in the theoretical
chapter. The implementation chapter gives the active construction; the
methodology and results chapters use it without re-deriving it.

## Experimental-method rules

Chapter 4 describes completed experiments, not an ideal or future protocol.
It should state:

- robot, tool, surface, fixture, and relevant software stack;
- configured and physical plane definitions;
- initial angular mismatch;
- fixed gains and swept variables;
- phase durations;
- repetitions;
- response metrics and steady-state calculation;
- repeatability assessment.

Keep the configured normal \(n_{\mathrm{cfg}}\) distinct from the physical
normal \(n_{\mathrm{phys}}\). Describe only the physical-plane method actually
used for the reported data. A proposed three-point calibration belongs in
Future Work, not in the completed methodology or results.

Hardware constraints belong in setup and operating constraints, not in the
scientific purpose statement.

## Results and conclusion priorities

The principal experimental conclusions are:

1. Lower tangential rotational stiffness increased contact-induced alignment
   over the tested range. Report the corresponding estimated normal-load
   range without claiming formal equivalence.
2. Both in-plane compliance-centre coordinates strongly influenced alignment.
3. The in-plane response was non-monotonic, and unsuitable placements reduced
   alignment or rotated the tool away from the desired orientation.
4. The normal compliance-centre coordinate added substantially less
   explanatory information over the investigated range.

Basic settling, formulation-equivalence, and repeatability checks support the
measurements but should not dominate the conclusion.

## Energy, passivity, and stability

Do not include an energy-based experimental objective, energy metric, or
energy-monitoring proposal unless it is directly relevant to a performed study.
Do not restore a standalone stability or passivity chapter. Algebraic symmetry
and positive-(semi)definiteness may be stated where needed, but they do not
prove closed-loop stability or passivity of the sampled
robot–controller–environment system.

## Final editorial checklist

Before accepting a revision:

- search for question-driven headings and literal research questions;
- search for Git, repository, development-history, and draft-comparison terms;
- search for proposal language outside Future Work;
- check configured versus physical plane terminology;
- check `estimated` versus `measured` force/wrench terminology;
- check experiment counts, repetitions, units, and parameter values;
- check predicted versus experimentally confirmed results;
- check Abstract, Kurzfassung, Results, and Conclusion for identical certainty;
- remove duplicated theory and unsupported causal claims;
- compile both `Thesis.tex` and `Professor_Draft.tex`;
- resolve undefined references and overfull boxes;
- visually inspect changed pages.

The final test for every sentence is whether it belongs in a robotics/control
thesis whose reader knows nothing about the author’s repository, coding
history, or earlier drafts.
