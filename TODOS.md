# Open items

This file contains only agreed work that remains unfinished. Completed items are
removed in the turn in which they are finished.

## Publish enough data to reproduce the figures

The run CSV files and derived contact metrics remain outside the repository.
Choose whether to publish `experiments/derived/metrics.csv` from
`Thesis_Final_Control` and one complete null-space run from `MyController`.
Preserve `MyController`'s calibration exclusion: its measured plane and
tool-axis calibration files are not to be published. If the data are placed in
this repository, the current scripts expect them below
`code/python/experiments/`.

## Verify the controller on the lab machine

The state-terminology refactor has passed the available Python, shell,
schema-compatibility, and static-analysis checks. The real C++ build and a
non-contact state-transition test still require the lab tree at
`/home/hm-panda/libfranka`, including `examples/examples_common.cpp`. Run both
before deploying the controller.

## Add a provenance warning for the video trials

The archived `V_ns*` trials used a \(40\,\mathrm{N}\) disturbance at a
\(150\,\mathrm{mm}\) offset and a faster timeline. The reported pose-hold study
used \(20\,\mathrm{N}\) at \(200\,\mathrm{mm}\). Add this distinction beside the
repository-authority rules in `code/AGENTS.md` so later analysis does not mix
the two configurations.

## Conditional maintenance for dormant appendices

- The retired, uncompiled files `backmatter/appendix_a_panda_example.tex` and
  `backmatter/appendix_c_exp1_rotated_tracking.tex` still contain `\approx`.
  Apply the current approximation rule before either file is reinstated.

## Follow-on physical-angle measurement

The reported logs define the contact-entry angle relative to the configured
surface reference. They do not contain an independently measured physical plane
normal or the tool face's motion relative to the end effector under load. A
follow-on experiment must record both before a run-wise physical tool--surface
angle can be evaluated.
